        <h1>Musqueam Indian Band</h1>
      </header>
      <br>

<p>Since time immemorial we’ve been on this land.</p>

<p>The oldest artifacts found here date back at least 9,000 years, but our stories recount people and times far more ancient than that.</p>

<p>Throughout these millennia we’ve had periods of great hardship and great prosperity. We’ve stayed here as a community through times of war, and peace. Through times of famine, and times of plenty. Through times of growth, and times of great despair. </p>

<p>In our times now, in our present day, our community is still here. As we always will be for all the sunsets to come. We are still here while all around the world people are searching, looking for answers to the grand questions of life.</p>

<p>Questions about the environment, and our individual connection to it. </p>

<p>Questions about the human family, and how we belong. </p>

<p>Questions about our condition as political, spiritual, and emotional beings, and our own place within these realms. </p>


<p>Today more than ever, the world needs models; examples of societies that have faced these issues and answered these questions before. </p>

<p>We are here. </p>

<p>Musqueam have been living the answers to these questions since the first sunrise. We have learned a way to be that works. </p>

<p>We have learned that all truths come from deep within us. The answers to all things are family, community, respect, sharing, trust, education, and responsibility. The Musqueam community still thrives on this land because our culture is based on these teachings. </p>

<p>And because we believe that all people and all things are connected, and that sharing and education are fundamental to success, we invite all peoples of the world to share these gifts with us. Live what we’ve learned. Learn what we’ve lived. Together we can get to a good place in a good way. </p>
<br>
<h1>Musqueam Capital Corporation</h1>
<br>
<p>We have always believed in using the best tools and best minds of the day to tackle our most pressing concerns, and these times are no different than any before. So, the Musqueam people, through their Chief and Council, created the Musqueam Capital Corporation.</p>

<p>The Musqueam Capital Corporation team comes together from many places, with varied backgrounds, and specialized areas of expertise. We were formed to create economic well-being and growth for Musqueam. Musqueam values of family, community, respect, sharing, trust, education and responsibility are at the forefront of every decision we make, and every action we take.</p>


<p>With these values in our hearts, with all good intentions, Musqueam Capital Corporation have created Block F as a new kind of complete community; as a gift to the world. Block F is a gift from Musqueam, a gift of knowledge and understanding about belonging, for those who are ready to receive.</p>

<br>
<h1>Block F</h1>
<br>

<p>Block F is on land we have stood on for longer than history. We are connected to each path, rock, and hill. We have used our deep understanding of how to create and maintain a community to envision a new way to live together, unlike any other before. This is hard-won knowledge, accumulated across thousands of years.</p>


<p>You’ll see it in the homes themselves. Each one is designed to be a place of refuge and peace. You’ll see it in the architecture, the path systems, the gathering places, the landscape, the environment-friendly measures and building materials, the amenities, and the opportunities we’ve created for you and your neighbours. You’ll see it in the intricate web of connections that makes all things one. </p>


<p>One heart. One mind. This is the Musqueam way of being.</p> 


<p>Choosing to live at Block F is means more than choosing a home. It means more than choosing a lifestyle. It means choosing to live with the same values that we all share, in a community of people who are there for the same reasons you are. </p>


<p>A community only thrives when people truly belong. In order to truly belong, you must put as much energy into the community as the community gives back to you. When this happens, something magical follows. There are no strangers. In our traditional language every word for friend also means family. </p>


<p>So consider this an invitation. To not just live here, but to be part of a true community. This is your invitation to belong, to be a friend, to be part of our family. </p>


<p>We’ve been preparing this place for you for more than 9,000 years. </p>
