        <h1>Cultural Respect Through Built Form</h1>
      </header>
      <br>
      <p class="bullets">Cedar should be used as much as possible</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Can we plant a cedar forest for future generations to enjoy?</p>
      <p class="bullets">References to weaving, earthtones with splashes of ochre and purple should figure prominently</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Wayfinding should honour the language by using geographical references: Forestside, Upriver, Downriver, and etc.</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Consider durational public art, begun now for future generations</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Design and include a symbolic nail at the entrance, or all entrances, on which to hang your worries and incongruent thoughts</p> 
      <p class="bullets"> Welcome posts are a given</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Design and build an outdoor fitness circuit, based on warrior training from Musqueam culture</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Attract birds and other wildlife</p> 
      <p class="bullets">As possible, scatter amenities throughout each building instead of concentrating them all on one floor, to encourage use of the whole building as your home</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Water should be always visible, streams and sluices that could lead to a central gathering place</p> 
      <p class="bullets">The river shoreline should be represented where edges between landscape materials are needed: perhaps we even ban straight lines?</p>
      <p class="bullets">River grass should be planted in abundance</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Plantings rescued before site clearing should be nurtured off-site, and brought back to the site when landscaping commences</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Consider light-bulbs that use the same wavelengths as sunlight</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Design and install a memorial place, for anyone who needs a quiet spot to remember their ancestors or lost ones, regardless of culture</p> 
      <p class="bullets">Find unique ways to represent connection: could all buildings have a steel bar that connects them physically, like a spider web that touches each structure in the community?</p>
      <p class="bullets">In community spaces and perhaps even in private homes, moveable walls, especially if they reference woven blankets in some way, would symbolically represent the blankets used to create rooms in the longhouse</p>
      <br>


      <header>
        <h1>Cultural Respect Through Belonging</h1>
      </header>
      <br>
      <p class="bullets">An App or community website could be developed where skills are shared and goods are exchanged, or given away</p>
      <p class="bullets">Programs to connect youth and elders should be developed</p>
      <p class="bullets">Elders can teach and youth could be trained to be community ambassadors</p>
      <p class="bullets">A big-brother/big-sister/volunteer-grandparents program could be implemented</p>
      <p class="bullets">Seniors and mothers with children will appreciate ample lighting, and more seating areas than expected</p>
      <p class="bullets">Seating can be physically designed and connected, to encourage interaction</p>
      <p class="bullets">Mailboxes can be lowered to encourage conversation</p>
      <p class="bullets">Other devices should be thought about that will make connecting with others more likely</p>
      <p class="bullets">Consider references to cultural themes in the way bylaws are written. Perhaps they include a social contract, where you must give back to the community in some way</p>
      <br>

      <header>
        <h1>Cultural Respect Through Marketing Tactics</h1>
      </header>
      <br>
      <p class="bullets">As MCC is a business to business institution, and while MIB addresses the world, consider an outward-facing MIB website, and transferring inward-facing language to the MCC website, or a site specifically accessible only by MIB members</p>
      <p class="bullets"> The Block F logo should relate to, and be born of, the MIB logo</p>
      <p class="bullets">Stories should be everywhere: a highly-visible and recognizable symbol to indicate “There is a Story Here,” should be created that can be part of the landscape, building details, paving stones, and all other places where it could potentially be used</p>
      <p class="bullets">A permanent recording device could be installed in the community centre, where people can record their stories, and answer the question “Who are you and where are you from?” These should be accessed easily by anyone interested in listening</p>
